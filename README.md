# Dragonar.io
 A project with slither.io type of vibe

	My second project, which i've started to work on it on September 22nd, 2024.

	Features:
	-a map
	-fruits, which can add or remove a link to the dragon
	-physics, specifically procedural animation of different links by making vectors between them
		if next link is further then a certain constant value from current link, current link is moving forward so it is just on the imaginary circle around next link with a radius of that const value
		if angle between centers of three links in order is less than a constant, i adjust it so the dragon does not break it's spine
		if the same angle is too low, when the dragon is boosting, his body is moving from side to side to make it look cute

	
	Features to add:
	- more files
		so that the game is not made in only class, its declaration and main fuction with loop
	- menu while opening app, menu on escape
		probably have to be in other files
	- music, sounds
		music - japanese lofi probbly, sounds from 8bit sounds generator
	- shooting
		can be like one of the guns in cuphead, or like a laser beam, which will be hard to aim, or a magic stream or smth
	- enemies
		those will be smart af
	- allies
		those will fly near your head, from the side closest to them
	- multiplayer
		will be like holding a point, or capturing some kind of flags
	- singleplayer
		campaign, a game versus bots or smth else
